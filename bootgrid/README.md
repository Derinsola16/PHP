# php BootGrid Server side Code Example

This code builds up BootGrid http://www.jquery-bootgrid.com/  a sleek table Jquery add-on for Bootstrap 
Bootstrap Bootgrid with PHP json server side script is a script that allows you to render server side data quickly and effectively using BootGrid , this means large database tabular data can easilly and uickly be displayed.

In this code a revised and enhanced the Bootgrid examples to use a PHP based backedn to read  a DB file (SQLite but works just as easily with MySQL, MariabDB etc.)
